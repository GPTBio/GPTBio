## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a CLI snake game that is easy to play and addictive. It should have a scoring system to track player progress and the game should become more challenging as the player's score increases. The game should run smoothly without any lags or glitches.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement snake navigation using keyboard controls", "P0"),
    ("Develop a scoring system to track player progress", "P0"),
    ("Increase game difficulty as player score increases", "P1"),
    ("Ensure the game runs smoothly with no lags or glitches", "P0"),
    ("Implement a quick restart feature for when the game ends", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will be a CLI application, so the UI will be text-based. The game area will be represented by a grid of characters, with different characters representing the snake, the food, and the empty spaces. The player's score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.

2023-08-11 02:25:38.547 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:58 - ## Implementation approach
We will use the curses library, which is a part of the Python standard library, to handle the CLI interface of the game. The curses library allows us to draw on the terminal screen, handle user input in real-time, and manage the terminal window size, all of which are crucial for our game.

The game logic will be encapsulated within a Game class, which will handle the game loop, user input, and game state. The Game class will use a Snake class to represent the snake, and a Food class to represent the food. The Snake class will be responsible for the movement and growth of the snake, while the Food class will handle the placement and consumption of food.

The difficulty of the game will increase as the player's score increases, by increasing the speed of the snake. The score will be tracked and displayed on the screen during gameplay.

The game will be packaged as a Python package, which can be installed and run from the command line.

## Python package name
```python
"cli_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py"

```

The \'Snake\' class is responsible for the movement and growth of the snake, while the \'Food\' class handles the placement and consumption of food.\n\nThe difficulty of the game increases as the player\'s score increases, by increasing the speed of the snake. The score is tracked and displayed on the screen during gameplay.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere doesn\'t seem to be anything unclear at the moment.
